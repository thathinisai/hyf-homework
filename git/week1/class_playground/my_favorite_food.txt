My Favorite Pizza Dough Recipe
The following method I patched together from recipes in both Joy of Cooking and Cook's Illustrated's The Best Recipe. The pizza dough recipe makes enough dough for two 10-12 inch pizzas.

Next time I'll be a bit more patient with stretching out the dough so I can get it even thinner.

The Best Flour for Homemade Pizza Dough
Bread flour is the best flour for homemade pizza dough. 
You can use all-purpose flour instead of the bread flour called for in the recipe,
 but bread flour is higher in gluten than all-purpose flour and will make a crispier crust for your pizza.
