As the world is advancing day by day, it is becoming easier to get access to many kinds of food at our doorstep. I have eaten many cuisines but my favourite food is definitely a burger. I cannot resist myself when it comes to burgers.

They are so soft yet crunchy, fresh and juicy that I love eating it. Even though there are many kinds of burger, my favourite one is a chicken burger. The chicken patty gives the burger a juicy taste and it tingles my taste buds every time I eat it.

I love eating burger which is filled with cheese and vegetables. The more vegetables you add, the better it tastes. My personal favourite is lettuce. It gives the burger the right amount of freshness and crunchiness.
